# Tezster
A personal development blockchain based on Javascript that lives entirely on your local machine. It will come as either a CLI or a GUI, has detailed mining controls (allowing you to set gas limits and block time), has log output, and the ability to run transactions or deploy contracts against the state of a live network such as the alphanet and zeronet, without spending any XTZ.
